#Walk through

Firstly, you will need to be familiar with the Quorum 7 node example [here](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 

You will need to startup the Quorum blockchain and deploy the SimpleStorage.sol contract.

Find the address of the deployed contract and add it to:

```javascript
var contractAddress = '0x1349f3e1b8d71effb47b840594ff27da7e603d17';
```

Then, assuming you have the node binary installed, move to the command line and run:

```
node server.js
```

You will then be able to browse to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) to interact with the Qourum blockchain
